            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>How A Man's Fitbit Got Him The Medical Care He Needed</h1><p>On Jan. 5, a man checked into a hospital's emergency room in Camden, New Jersey. Because his heart was beating irregularly, doctors suspected he had atrial fibrillation, the most common type of arrhythmia, which can increase the risk of stroke. But to decide how to treat him, they needed to know exactly how long his heart had been acting up.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/2540bffcfc76dfb2a5e2975d8809099dcd0b592c.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>A Fresh Take On Coffee T-Shirts</h1><p>The coffee shop has always been one of the great incubators for artist-types. It's a home base for creative nomads, where those not shackled to desk jobs go to sketch, write, or just ideate into leather-bound notepads, propped up only by a cup of coffee and, depending on your location and era, a pack of cigarettes.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/99ea5a102a376f1a2a0d9187d3764592ee86f921.jpg"></article>]]></description>

They won't die even if you cut them in half. To kill one, you must dismember it completely-or inject it with poisonous (to them) bile salts. Instead of braaains, these zombies munch coral, and off the coast of Australia, infestations of the beasts are damaging the Great Barrier Reef at an alarming rate.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/df2ff642b24f92833cf4da9277a687034f647587.jpg"></article>]]></description>
